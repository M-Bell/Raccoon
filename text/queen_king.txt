The king and queen endgame is one of the most common endgames that you will see in chess. It usually comes about from a king and pawn endgame, where the pawn is promoted to a queen. The goal in this endgame is to limit the squares that the opponent’s king can move. This is done by moving the queen slowly down the board, taking away a file or rank every time the king moves back. Once the king is trapped in a corner, you can bring your king into the action and checkmate the opponent’s king
