The king and rook endgame is very common and definitely one that every chess player should master. Much like the king and queen endgame, the goal is to slowly move the rook down the board, limiting the spaces that the opponentâ€™s king can move. If the king gets too close the rook can simply move along the same rank away from the king and continue up the board. With practice this will become one of the easiest endgames for you to master.
