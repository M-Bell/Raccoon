"How knight moves?"
WFM Alexandra Botez on Magnus Carlsen interwiew after game 5 of match against Ian Niepomniashchi for world champion title
Answer:
"The Knight moves 1 square along a rank or file and then 1 square diagonally away from it's original square"

Knight is the only piece, which can jump over other pieces: if square, where knight can move is free, knight can move here
